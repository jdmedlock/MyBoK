# WebDevBoK - The WebDev Book of Knowledge

## Purpose

To do their job and to do it effectively Web Developers are required to 
be familiar with multiple technologies, languages, libraries, tools, 
frameworks, processes, and procedures. Memorizing information with this
breadth, complexity, and sheer volume of information is a daunting task.

The purpose of this repo is to collect, organize, and document this 
information in a way that makes it easy to find and use. In other words,
to make this information readily available and actionable so you don't 
have to memorize it.

As you might expect this information is categorized and indexed to make
it easy to find. At the highest level categorization centers on the
major elements of the WebDev's normal workflow. Namely, design,
development, operations, and project management.
